A simple and intuitive currency converter application that allows users to convert between various international currencies in real time.
# 🛠️ Installation & Setup

## 1. Clone the Repository

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/currency-converter-app.git
cd currency-converter-app
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

   
## 3. Run the App

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
